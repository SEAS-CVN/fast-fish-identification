# Real-time Fish Identification for ecosystem monitoring

## ðŸŒŠ Overview

An edge-optimized machine learning system for real-time identification of fish species native to Dong Hoi, Quang Binh (Central Vietnam). This project leverages computer vision and efficient ML architectures to enable accurate fish classification on resource-constrained hardware.

## ðŸ“‹ Background

Dong Hoi is a coastal city in Central Vietnam known for its thriving seafood industry and marine biodiversity. Accurate and efficient fish species identification is crucial for:

- Supporting sustainable fishing practices
- Environmental monitoring and conservation
- Quality control in seafood processing
- Scientific research on local marine ecosystems

Traditional identification methods rely on expert visual inspection, which presents significant limitations in speed, consistency, and real-time application.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

This project aims to develop a real-time machine learning solution that:

- Accurately identifies fish species from visual data
- Operates efficiently on low-power edge devices (FPGA accelerators, embedded systems)
- Functions reliably in challenging marine environments
- Provides an accessible interface for various stakeholders

## ðŸ”¬ Applications

- Marine research vessels
- Fishing industry automation
- Ocean-monitoring robots and autonomous underwater vehicles
- Environmental conservation efforts
- Educational tools for marine biodiversity
